- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rudra Prasadh Ganesh
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding, chess, piano, and Rubik's cubes!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React.js, Verilog, and embedded C; and at the moment I know C, Java, C++, Javascript, R, Python, and Git. I know some basic typescript, dart (and flutter), and Unreal Engine Game development. I hope to develop all the knowledge I've gained and apply it in projects and internships.
